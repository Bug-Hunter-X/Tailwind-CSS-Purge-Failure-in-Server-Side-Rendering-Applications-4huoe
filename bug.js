This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js that uses server-side rendering (SSR).  The issue is that Tailwind's purge functionality might not correctly identify all the classes used in your components, especially when those components are dynamically rendered or imported conditionally. This results in purged classes that are still referenced within the application, causing runtime errors or unexpected styling behavior. For example, conditional rendering in a component might cause classes present only in some states to be removed by the purge process, leading to missing styles.
